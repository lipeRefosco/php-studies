# PHP Studies

In this repository, I will put some studies and concepts using PHP, like Coroutine, EventLoops, Async, Sockets blocking and non-blocking and other concepts of Computer Science.

## Studies I have been taken

- [Coroutine](https://github.com/lipeRefosco/coroutine-in-php)
- [Event Loop](https://github.com/lipeRefosco/php-studies/tree/main/eventloop)

### Parallel Studies - Fail
- [Codes](https://github.com/lipeRefosco/php-studies/tree/main/parallel)
In this study, I am attempting to run PHP code in parallel, using system calls, but syscall functions, in Php, are blocking.
